# ECS175 Assignments
Assignments from UCDavis ECS175, more specifically [Ken Joy]'s  course. The only difference is that I chose to use WebGL, JS and HTML instead of OpenGL and Qt.

 - Some images of the garbage cans of Kemper Hall are here needed and greatly appreciated. I have no idea what they look like.
